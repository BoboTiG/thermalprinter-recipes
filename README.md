# ThermalPrinter Recipes

If you do not know what this repository is about, just see it as a snippet stock for the [ThermalPrinter](https://github.com/BoboTiG/thermalprinter) module.

You will find several use cases for your DP-EH600 thermal printer.

Each subdirectory or file in the **recipes** folder represents a use case. It can be anything that is dealing with the printer.
Just go into that folder, a complete list of recipes is displayed.
